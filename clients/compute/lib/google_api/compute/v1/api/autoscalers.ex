  alias GoogleApi.Compute.V1.Connection
  import GoogleApi.Compute.V1.RequestBuilder


  @doc """
  Retrieves an aggregated list of autoscalers.

  ## Parameters

  - connection (GoogleApi.Compute.V1.Connection): Connection to server
  - project (String): Project ID for this request.
  - opts (KeywordList): [optional] Optional parameters
    - :alt (String): Data format for the response.
    - :fields (String): Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.
    - :key (String): API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.
    - :oauth_token (String): OAuth 2.0 token for the current user.
    - :pretty_print (Boolean): Returns response with indentations and line breaks.
    - :quota_user (String): Available to use for quota purposes for server-side applications. Can be any arbitrary string assigned to a user, but should not exceed 40 characters. Overrides userIp if both are provided.
    - :user_ip (String): IP address of the site where the request originates. Use this if you want to enforce per-user limits.
    - :filter (String): Sets a filter {expression} for filtering listed resources. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.  The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.  For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use name ne example-instance.  You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
    - :max_results (Integer): The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
    - :order_by (String): Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy&#x3D;\&quot;creationTimestamp desc\&quot;. This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
    - :page_token (String): Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.

  ## Parameters

  - connection (GoogleApi.Compute.V1.Connection): Connection to server

    - :user_ip (String): IP address of the site where the request originates. Use this if you want to enforce per-user limits.
    - :request_id (String): An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.  For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.  The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
